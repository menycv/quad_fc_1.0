In this file I'm gonna present the scope of this project,
*My mount everest*
- Dedicated to my future wife and kids as well as my parents who always backed me up in every decision I made

Okay first of all we need to define what do we want the dron to do. Since I'm starting I'm just going to add basic functions to it so it can fly and balance itself.

Functions:
1. Stabilize during flight when there's no change in setpoints, just throttle
2. Maximum angle of acceleratin in Y and X axis of 30* degrees

And I think that's it
